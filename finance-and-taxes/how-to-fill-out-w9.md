# How to Fill Out a W9

What is a W9? Someone wanted to pay me $1000k (woot! Totally unexpected, but also totally fair) so said:

> Yo, fill out this w9 and I'll send you money, maybe w/ Zelle or Quickpay or something, otherwise I'll initiate an ACH payment

And I was like... huh?

So... 

Where did I have my EIN saved somewhere? I formed an LLC and filed it with the state of Colorado, and... did something with the IRS... and then left it all on a shelf? Where was all that?

## My Publishable business details:

Er, I hope? 

- Name: `Toehold LLC`
- ID Number: `20201737049`
- Formation note: `08/25/2020`



## Where to send payouts
