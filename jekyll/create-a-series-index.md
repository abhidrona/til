# How To Create A Series Index

Phew. this has been hard for me. 

I've got series indexes for:

- [Turing Prep Chapter 1: Make Mod 1 Easier Than It Otherwise Would Be](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro)
- [Jekyll Bug Fix with Matt Series Index](https://intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-1-finding-an-issue)

Looks like:

![intermediate_ruby](/sinatra/images/jekyll-series-index.jpg)

and

![mod 1 prep](/sinatra/images/turing-prep-series-index.jpg)

I did both in slightly different ways, and don't really like either. 

As I make improvements, I'll capture those notes here.
