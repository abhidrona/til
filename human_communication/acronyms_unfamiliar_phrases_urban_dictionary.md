# Use Urban Dictionary to look up acronyms and unfamiliar phrases

I encounter unfamilar acronyms and phrases _all the time_. 

And it always makes me feel like an old clueless man.

For example:

> I want the world to be a nicer place. AITA?

or 

> TIL water is bad for my cell phone

I always pop unfamiliar acronyms into [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) and figure it out. ([AITA](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=AITA)), ([TIL](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TIL))
