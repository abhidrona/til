# :memo: TIL

> Today I Learned, or TIL: Often used as a space saver on websites such as Reddit or DIGG when writing the titles of links to interesting things the submitter has learned that day.

_This is inspired by the mega-useful [📝 Today I Learned ](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) repo by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud)_

I'm sticking all sorts of learnings here. Much of it related to software, but certainly not all of it.
