# What is "Flat" and "Flatness"?

### Caption:

> Got all 3 plates machined and slotted/grooved.

> Photo 2 shows one of the plates surface ground just to get below the feed marks

> Photo 3 shows the same plate after I passed over its surface with a flat ground stone. You can see the grind marks, revealing that surface grinding does not yield that flat of a surface (relatively speaking). Additionally, you can see the contrasting 2 portions, my surface grinder ran out of travel around 6" and I had to spin the plate around, then finish the last 2" from the other direction. As a result you can sort of see the two regions meet.

I asked:

> What will these be used for?

A few days later, in Whatsapp, I received:

> Re the post on instagram, the best way to explain what the plates are for is almost like a mathematical proof. Theoretically, you can take any three planes, follow a series of steps and get a perfectly flat plane.
> 
> In the physical world, it's more like take 3 relatively flat planes, follow some steps, and get 3 very flat plates (but you run into limitations with this method around a certain degree of flatness)

Me:

> I am ruined for how curious I am for the practical uses of these metal plates.
>
> What real world the value is delivered with them? I have no doubt that there's plenty. I just can't imagine it.
>
> I understand that nothing is 'truly flat' IRL, so I'm fascinated by increasingly effortful attempts to get closer and closer to 'flat'
>
> It is like adding another nine to the degree of flatness. 99% flat is a far cry from 99.9% flat, etc
>
> If a planer for flattening a piece of wood can achieve 99% flatness. I suspect those three discs are closer to 99.9 or 99.99% flat.

His response:

> Flatness as a definition is kind of tricky, because even if you had a "perfect" flat plane made up of physical material, atoms/molecules are generally not cubic/have no flat faces, they're generally point-field/spherical-ish shaped.

> Flatness is most commonly taking the average deviation from perfect flatness

> OR

> the maximum deviation from the highest point on a surface to the lowest point

> There are physical phenomena that you need things to be flat enough so that they will work
> 
> 1. bearing surfaces, so like 2 flat plates on top of one another, many times with a film of lubricant between them can make it easy to move an object resting on top of one of the plates even if it is tons and tons and tons of weight

> 2. A pressurized seal, imagine pressing two pipes together and having them be water tight even to tens or hundreds of thousands of PSI

> The biggest thing honestly is that measurement has no meaning if there is no reference. If you try to give me a physical example of what 45Â° looks like, it ultimately needs to come back to being in relation to a plane. And physically speaking, one would need to know how flat their plane is before being able to define an angle.
