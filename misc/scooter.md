# Learnings about a scooter

If possible:

1. Get a scooter at Sportique. They make the legal side of everything easy. I just got my paperwork in the mail from Sportique, ready for me to drive over to the DMV.
2. you have 60 days from purchase to register vehicle
3. Motorcycle license is not mandatory
4. More CCs is better - I have a 125cc, feels adequate for what I want to do.
5. First 500 miles, go easy on accelleration and riding at full throttle for extended periods of time.
6. I'm only at 400 miles ridden
7. it gets cold. I now keep motorcycle gloves, long-sleeved shirt, and reusable bag in the seat with me at all times. 
8. It's a bit underpowered with a passenger, but maybe once I hit 500 miles I'll ride a bit "faster", and not feel as limited by the power. Wouldn't go below 125cc. 
9. You can park it anywhere.
10. super maneuverable. more fun than I would have expected, but keep in mind I "meander" a lot. 
11. I've not had to ride when it's cold yet. When doing long rides into Denver, it'll be hot. Take a liter of water, wear long sleeves, long pants, and gloves. Protect your skin.
