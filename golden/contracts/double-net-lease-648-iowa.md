# Term sheet for double net lease on 648 Iowa

_For reasons explained [here](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/golden/contracts/why-track-contracts-publicly-in-git.md), I like to track important documents in a version control system. Git/github is my VCS of choice._

- Josh Thompson will have a double lease of 648 Iowa, from Rodney Jones.
- Rodney will pay water and property taxes and insurance at $2750pcm. 
- Every month, by the 30th of the prior month, Josh will have payment of $2750 for Rodney
- Josh will manage the property, including subletting other rooms if he so chooses
- This double net lease operates in conjunction with the [Call option](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/golden/contracts/term-sheet-option-on-648-iowa.md) josh is purchasing from Rodney.
- As this double net lease and call option on the house is very related to the [Planned Unit Design](https://josh.works/pud) document Josh is working on, Rodney will formally attest (in writing) that he supports Josh's efforts. This will probably look like Rodney adding his name to a petition Josh will soon make available. 
- All income and other utilities would move to Josh, who would have the option to rent the other rooms, garage land, etc.
- Repairs would be at Josh's cost
- double net lease has the same beginning/ending terms as the call option (Nov 1, 2021-Oct 31, 2022)

# Verbal Handshake deal/evidence

The above didn't get signed, but more-or-less worked out the same as the call option.

## Evidence

I'd planned on uploading/marking here records for the payments, time-stamped in Github, as [demonstration of provenence](https://www.kalzumeus.com/essays/dropping-hashes/). Bank statements function as the same, etc. 

The property, when running at capacity with three additional rented-out rooms to rotating tenants, was generating $2750/mo.

In various ways, three of those rooms emptied out, and I, Josh, suggested/agreed to filling the gap in rent, so the current tenants could avoid paying more (they didn't have more to spend) and could have the luxurious stability of not having strangers and untrusted people on the property regularly. 

I doubt I'll update this document monthly, but as of 2022-03-20 here's where we stand:

| Month | Josh Paid Rodney | L&T&M Paid Rodney | 
|---|---|---|
Nov 2021 | $1575 | $1175
Dec 2021 | $1575 | $1175
Jan 2022 | $1575 | $1175
Feb 2022 | $1575 | $1175
March 2022 | $1575 | $1175
April 2022 | $0 | $0
May 2022 | $0 | $0
June 2022 | $0 | $0
July 2022 | $0 | $0
August 2022 | $0 | $0
September 2022 | $0 | $0

I'm planning on continuing my payments, of course, until coming up with something better. My wife and I both work in tech. [Software developers in Denver are doing just fine](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/denver-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,6_IM234_KO7,24.htm), so this monthly outlay is simultaneously _shockingly huge_ and _trivial_ at the same time. I always think in dollars-per-hour and dollars-per-month. A $100k/yr salary is ~$50/hr at 40hrs/week, or $8300/mo (pretax. lolsob.)

I'll add evidence similar to the term sheet. I hope to use similar document-provenence-processes for other contracts going forward.

This is to "buy time" for the [financial product](https://josh.works/collateralizing-financial-products-with-present-value-of-rent-flow) and/or [rezoning project](https://josh.works/pud). 

Each month, I drop off a check and three money orders at Rodney's account.

I've usually been current/early, sometimes life has me a few days late. It's been NBD. Rodney's been a dream. Extremely easy to work with, happy to try very unconventional things. A consumate professional.
