# Between Josh Thompson and the Residents at 648 Iowa Street

_Document Status: This is very much a draft document, I expect many revisions to come, but I wanted to start collecting thoughts._

"The residents" are Laura, Tanya, and Merlin, residents of 648 Iowa St, Golden, CO 80403.

I, Josh, a neighbor (and owner of 621 Iowa across the street), am working on moving the property into their hands, and count as the current "landlord" via a [double net lease](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/golden/contracts/double-net-lease-648-iowa.md) between myself and the current owner of the property, Rodney. This double net lease was the best way for us to satisfy various goals.

I hope to perhaps see On Tap offer a [new financial product](https://josh.works/collateralizing-financial-products-with-present-value-of-rent-flow), and ideally would get to implement this new product in aiding 648 Iowa in a financially sound and low-debt way into the hands of the current tenants. (Read the above document!)

Myself and the Residents have a long list of easily-agreed-upon desired outcomes, here's some draft language for just some of those goals:

## Agreed-upon desired outcomes

- The residents become full owners of the entire property for $900k, using half of the property as collateral for a $1m loan.
- Josh will get to generally "put to productive commercial use" the north west corner of the lot, with the goal of building several small studio spaces that could support a rental income of $5k/mo, without any individual space costing more than $1k/mo. He'll use "traditional practices" like [rammed earth walls and masonry heaters](https://josh.works/surprisingly-good-for-the-cost).
- Josh is happy to do this because he'll be doing the same thing on his own property, eagerly pursuing neighborhood health, economic independence, and intergenerational living. 
- The residents will be free to use their property however they wish, as is obviously the intent behind [this Planned Unit Development document](https://josh.works/pud)
- the residents can make full use of the property, including planting any sorts of trees, brushes, plants, cactus, etc.
- they can install solar panels
- they can register the house as a historical landmark, which could help finance some repairs, and would be cool either way. My understanding is it's the first house in North Golden. 
- I, Josh, will provide as much support as I can marshal via myself/my network to support these outcomes. I'm currently [putting ~$1500/mo](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/master/golden/contracts/double-net-lease-648-iowa.md) into it, which is unfortunately "just" going to rent, not funding any repairs or anything.

## Addendums

- Tenants have paid $1300 towards repairs of the house
- Any new rental structures built on the leaned portion of property will be the property of the tenants upon paying off the mortgage of the property, or upon sale of the land.
- A well is to be built on the property.
- Any repairs will be reimbursed for items & labor. If the property is placed in the tenants ownership, those costs not reimbursed will be forgiven. 
- Surveys need to be done to verify property lines
- Privacy wall to be built upon property and reimbursed to tenants if the sale of property does not go through.
