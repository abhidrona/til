# Between Josh Thompson and the residents at 648 Iowa

_Document Status: This is very much a draft document, I expect many revisions to come, but I wanted to start collecting thoughts._

"The residents" are Laura, Tanya, and Merlin, current residents of 648 Iowa St, Golden, CO 80403.

I, Josh, a neghbor/owner of 621 Iowa across the street, am working on moving the property into their hands, and count as the current "landlord" via a [double net lease](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/golden/contracts/double-net-lease-648-iowa.md) between myself and the owner of the property, Rodney, which was the best way for us to satisfy various goals.

I hope to perhaps see On Tap offer a [new financial product](https://josh.works/collateralizing-financial-products-with-present-value-of-rent-flow), and ideally would get to implement this new product in aiding 648 Iowa in a financially sound and low-debt way into the hands of the current tenants. (Read the above document!)

Myself and the tenants have a long list of easily-agreed-upon desired outcomes, here's some draft language for just some of thos goals:

## Agreed-upon desired outcomes

- The residents become full owners of the entire property for $900k, using half of the property as collateral for a $1m loan.
- Josh will get to generally "put to productive commercial use" the north west corner of the lot, with the goal of building several small studio spaces that could support a rental income of $5k/mo, without any individual space costing more than $1k/mo. He'll use "traditional practices" like [rammed earth walls and masonry heaters](https://josh.works/surprisingly-good-for-the-cost).
- Josh is happy to do this because he'll be doing the same thing on his own property, eagerly pursuing neighborhood health, economic independence, and intergenerational living. 
- The residents will be free to use their property however they wish, as is obviously the intent behind [this pud](https://josh.works/pud)
- the residents can make full use of the property, including planting any sorts of trees, brushes, plants, cactus, etc.
- they can install solar panels
- they can register the house as a historical landmark, which could help finance some repairs, and would be cool either way. My understanding is it's the first house in North Golden. 
- I, Josh, will provide as much support as I can marshal via myself/my network to support these outcomes. I'm currently [putting ~$1500/mo](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/master/golden/contracts/double-net-lease-648-iowa.md) into it, which is unfortunately "just" going to rent, not funding any repairs or anything.

- extra thing 2 
- extra thing 3
