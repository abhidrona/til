# Between Josh Thompson and the residents at 648 Iowa

_Document Status: This is very much a draft document, I expect many revisions to come, but I wanted to start collecting thoughts._

"The residents" are Laura, Tanya, and Merlin, current residents of 648 Iowa St.

I, Josh, am the neighbor, am working on moving the property into their hands, and count as the current "landlord" via a triple-net-lease between myself and the owner of the property, Rodney. 

I am working on introducing a [new financial product](https://josh.works/collateralizing-financial-products-with-present-value-of-rent-flow), and ideally would get to implement this new thing in aiding 648 Iowa into the hands of the current tenants.

Myself and the tenants have a long list of easily-agreed-upon desired outcomes. They're easy for me to agree to, despite some of them perhaps being non-traditional items for including in contracts. 

## Agreed-upon desired outcomes

- The residents become full owners of the entire property for $900k, using half of the property as collateral for a $1m loan
- Josh will get to generally "put to productive commercial use" the north west corner of the lot, with the goal of building several small studio spaces that could support a rental income of $5k/mo, without any individual space costing more than $1k/mo.
- The residents will be free to use their property however they wish, as is obviously the intent behind [this pud](https://josh.works/pud)
- the residents can make full use of the property, including planting any sorts of trees, brushes, plants, cactus, etc.
- they can install solar panels
- they can register the house as a historical landmark, which could help finance some repairs, and would be cool either way. My understanding is it's the first house in North Golden. 
- I, Josh, will provide as much support as I can marshal via myself/my network to support these outcomes. I'm currently [putting ~$1500/mo](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/master/golden/contracts/double-net-lease-648-iowa.md) into it, which is unfortunately "just" going to rent, not funding any repairs or anything.
