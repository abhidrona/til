# Term sheet for one-year call option on 648 Iowa

_For reasons explained [here](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/golden/contracts/why-track-contracts-publicly-in-git.md), I like to track important documents in a version control system. Git/github is my VCS of choice._

### Notes

I wrote this document to model how Wikipedia defines an option:

> A financial option is a contract between two counterparties with the terms of the option specified in a term sheet. Option contracts may be quite complicated; however, at minimum, they usually contain the following specifications:[8]
> 
>     whether the option holder has the right to buy (a call option) or the right to sell (a put option)
>     the quantity and class of the underlying asset(s) (e.g., 100 shares of XYZ Co. B stock)
>     the strike price, also known as the exercise price, which is the price at which the underlying transaction will occur upon exercise
>     the expiration date, or expiry, which is the last date the option can be exercised
>     the settlement terms, for instance whether the writer must deliver the actual asset on exercise, or may simply tender the equivalent cash amount
>     the terms by which the option is quoted in the market to convert the quoted price into the actual premium â€“ the total amount paid by the holder to the writer
