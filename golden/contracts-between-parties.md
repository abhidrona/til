# Contracts Between Parties

_To see how this document has evolved over time, please view it in [githistory](https://github.githistory.xyz/josh-works/til/blob/main/golden/contracts-between-parties.md)_

## OnTap Credit Union and Buyer

This document would be binding between the following parties:

- [OnTap Credit Union](https://www.ontapcu.org/), hereby "the bank", "the financial institution"
- the buyers: Laura, Merlin, and Tanya, residing at [648 Iowa St, Golden, CO](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/648-Iowa-St-Golden-CO-80403/13709768_zpid/)

Referencing the property at:

648 Iowa St, Golden, CO

The bank will provide a zero-percent-down loan to buy the property on behalf of the buyers. The bank will:

1. Make the current owner of the property whole, so ownership transfers to the buyers cleanly and completely.
2. Provide the agreed-upon line-of-credit, if necessary, to fund the necessary property renovations
3. An agreed-upon fraction of the property provides all collateral


### Land as collateral

The bank will take on the loan, purchasing the property from Rodeny James, turning ownership over to the buyers.

Immediately after that transaction is concluded (in the same day) a contract will be executed in which the bank buys 4800 sq ft of the lot from the buyers (merlin, laura, tanya) at $208/sq ft, and payments will be deferred until at least $100k has been spent rehabilitating the property. 

Now the buyers own half of the lot free and clear, and can of course "buy back" the rest of the lot from the credit union. 

The Credit Union will purchase 4800 sq feet of the lot from the buyers at $208/sq ft

The credit union will "own" half of the lot, at a negotiated price. The other half of the lot will belong, free and clear, to the buyers. 

As the properties get rehabilitated, and additional income starts coming in (or other portions of the property is sold) the buyers can progressively buy out OnTap from the other half of the lot. 


## Most Immediate Neighbors

Josh & Kristi Thompson, living directly across from 648 Iowa, strongly support this arrangement.

## Iowa St & N Columbine St Neighbors

TBD, but I could get all these neighbors to go in:

- Joe & Trish
- Luke & Tracy
- Chris and his fam/neighbor
- coffee & donut crew
- many more

All could say something like:

> I, the person living in (and owning/renting) the property at {address} approve of this plan, as has been explained to me. I know where to find info about the project online, and I generally have a degree of trust and confidence in my neighbors, as befitting someone who's broken bread at their house.
>
> We understand that our neighbors will be able to stay in the property, and will own the land outright, even as some of the land will be used by the bank to reduce it's risk to default, which, if happens, means the land might be split and sold. 



This reduces regulatory risk for the bank, the sellers, and the city.

## Zoning Laws

Some of the terms of this contract would be rendered unfulfillable because of modern zoning regulations regarding:

- minimum parking requirements
- minimum lot size requirements
- maximum floor-area ratios

More specific details will be ironed out in the future, but in general, the neighbors and involved parties support how this might need to unfold, and don't want it held up by running afoul of certain laws and rules. 

In order to obtain the necessary relief, we're currently leaning towards:

1. A lot-wide PUD
2. A corner-encompasing PUD
3. a neighborhood-wide PUD
4. something else?
