# How to Soundproof a Room

I don't know that I'll ever get "soundproofed", but we live in an old house with _horrific_ noise propogation. 

Keep in mind:

- Green glue (1 tube per sheet of drywall)
- Vynil mass (1/4" on floor, 1/8" on walls)
- Double sheets of drywall (2 layers 5/8th drywall with green glue between)
- Air gaps
- Insulate foam around all outlet/switch boxes
- avoid air vents if possible

## Doors

Remove door casing, all-the way around: [https://youtu.be/xXHeIOEOiAA?t=1122](https://youtu.be/xXHeIOEOiAA?t=1122)

Fill gap between drywall and door frame with expansion foam.

Solid-core door.

Add a door-stop system with a "active sweep" device that seals along floor when door is closed.


## Windows

## Walls/Ceilings

Drywall: 2 sheets of 5/8" drywall with glue between, staggered edges

between subfloor and drywall: GreenGlue Sealent

Between Drywall and Drywall: Greenglue soundproofing

### Gear-drive Panel Lift

Makes moving/installing sheets of drywall (especially the heavy drywall) easy and safe.
