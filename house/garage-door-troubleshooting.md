# I had to fix my garage door

There ended up being four problems:

1. The door wouldn't go down
1. The door went down and bounced back up
1. When the door went down and bounced back up, the "main drive bar" flexed hard. Way too much torque applied to it
1. The door didn't go all the way down

Youtube videos I made after the fix:
