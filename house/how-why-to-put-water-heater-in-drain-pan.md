# How and Why To Put a Water Heater in a Drain Pan

Our water heater doesn't have a drain pan.

Drain pans are needed because when a heater end-of-life's, I _think_ it can disgorge water at any time, and, if that water just... goes wherever it is, it's a huge hassle. 

Our water heater is old, and wonky, and might be fairly close to end-of-lifed, and I want this done within a few weeks. 

## Steps:

1. I need a pan (what kind of pan?)
2. I need a hose to drain it (where? I've got some )
3. I need to actually drain the water heater
4. Use a dolly or something to "jack" it up, get a pan in.

## Complications

- It's an old floor
- Tiny space next to a washing machine
- My back is a mess, and I'd love to do this with a minimum physical labor
- I really don't feel like I need a plumber for this, if it was like $300. If they'd say "sure, super easy, give us $50 and 20 minutes" I'd just pay them.
- draining it around the corner to back yard? Front yard doesn't drain well, do I _really_ want to add more water to the front of the building?

## Tools/materials

### The pan itself

Looks simple enough, except _every single one of them_ has a hole in it for a drain.

Do I need to add a drain/plumbing line thing? Eff. Way more complicated.
