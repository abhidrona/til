# Why and How to Install a French Drain

Water runs off our street, "piles up" against our foundation, and causes the house to be pushed around _a lot_.

This kind of "getting pushed around" has caused a LOT of foundation movement.

There are non-trivial cracks all over the house. I don't think the roof's about to fall in, but... the house was built in 1955, this has been happening for 65+ years, and I'd like to stop the shifting before it gets _even worse_.

We had an engineer give us an estimate of costs for remediation, and he said we could do:

1. nothing (free! Nothing's been done for 65 years!)
2. french drain (very cheap, stops the movement)
3. Super expensive hydraulic jacking up 3/4th of the house ($65k)

I'll be doing it myself. 

Here's the house/profile:

## Complications

- I want to demo out our driveway, make it permeable
- I want to demo out sidewalk, make it permeable
- I'd have to demo out sidewalk anyway for French Drain, and some of driveway
- is this project is contingent upon knowing what to do in front yard?

## Nice-to-haves

- Can I do something useful with the water I'll be moving? Even if only to passively water a vegetable garden or something?
- I want to move all the dirt out, but do something useful w/the dirt, so I don't have to cart it off?
- Can I in-fill over the trench with rocks I obtain from near by?
- "non-woven geotextile fabric" or something is the only way to go, according to the french drain expert


## Demoing out asphalt and concrete

is there a way to save it/repurpose it at all?
