# How I/we compost

I've fallen down the composting rabbithole a bit. 

It ties together things that have value to me. Here's a scratchpad of notes.

## The Canonical Resource

Please read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964425882/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1). 

## How I know when I am/am not composting

I bought [this compost thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/REOTEMP-Backyard-Compost-Thermometer-Instructions/dp/B002P5RGMI/ref=sr_1_5?crid=AUJV4T2EE4Z&keywords=compost+thermometer+long&qid=1639430384&sprefix=compost+thermo%2Cstripbooks%2C201&sr=8-5) on amazon.

As soon as it arrived, I popped it into my compost container, and it read a comfortable 75 degrees. (this was mid-summer)

It hung out there for a few weeks, and as soon as I dumped in nitrogen, the temperature popped to 120 degrees (within hours) and stayed there for a few weeks.

## What I compost

Everything. Our trashcans that go to the curb no longer stink, because we don't put anything that can make a smell into it.

We have a dog, and use compostable waste bags. We toss those bags into the compost, along with everything else.

# Golden-specific composting

The rest of this will be related to various bits of troubleshooting I've done

## Sawdust

By far, the hardest part of this has been to obtain sawdust that meets the sweet spots:

- quantity
- quality
- availability (effort, cost, etc)

I started six months ago hustling on NextDoor, and spent hours driving around to get a relatively small amount of sawdust. 

I called local lumbar yards and sawmills (as I was instructed to do from the book) and kept coming up empty.

Finally, one company suggested:

> There's a random wood shop on 44th that might have sawdust, check with them

and I called [Growth Ring Innovations](https://g.page/growthringinnovations?share).

The owner is great, he's got tons of sawdust.

### Quantity

Long story short, he's got more sawdust than I can ever use, by two orders of magnitude.

Have you ever seen a 40 cubic yard dumpster full of sawdust? Have you walked on top of it?

I have.

And they fill up one of those things a month. Insane. 

So, they've got sawdust.

- [x] find enough sawdust

### Quality

The 'finer' the sawdust, the better. Duh. It's true for more than just sawdust. In the context of composting, you want it like powder. Kick the bag, and a puff of sawdust shoots into the air. (and your lungs. You didn't actually kick the bag, right?)

Course sawdust is... course. 

So, I'm still trying to solve that piece. I know all this because my first trip to Growth Rings netted me about 100 lbs of super fine sawdust, hand-delivered by two kind men into the back seat of my car, in a nice plastic bag.

My next trip, I took that bag (and four more like it) on a day when I could get at the sawdust in the dumpster. 

It was coarser. So, this piece isn't solved.

### Affordability/effort

So far, I've not paid for any sawdust, but I've also expended quite a bit of effort to get it. It's something I'll have to do (at the current rate) a few times a year, so if I can do it in my toyota corolla, near-effortlessly, and for free, I'm thrilled.

I'm hoping to get to pick up this one giant bag of sawdust (full of really powdery sawdust) whenever the shop fills it up. I need to call him back and ask about this, but it's not urgent.

## Compost Container(s)

the house we just bought had a compost container on it when we arrived. That's why I started composting. If I hadn't had the container, I probably would have started something by now, but it wasn't a huge priority to me.

That compost container and a conversation with a friend led to me reading the above book, and as I read it, I ordered myself [this compost thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/REOTEMP-Backyard-Compost-Thermometer-Instructions/dp/B002P5RGMI/ref=sr_1_5?crid=AUJV4T2EE4Z&keywords=compost+thermometer+long&qid=1639430384&sprefix=compost+thermo%2Cstripbooks%2C201&sr=8-5) and just monitored the temperature and such as I went.

The first change I made was I removed the plastic lid from the container - a proper compost pile doesn't need to be covered. 

The book author lives in damp Grove City, PA, an hour north of Pittsburgh, and I live in a high-altitude desert, so preventing the pile from drying out too much is a thing I'm sorting out. More on that later. 

I started trying to rustle up some pallets, and eventually did. 

Despite the author's claim that a compost container could be built in 15 min, it's like a cooking show saying meal prep is 10 min, _because everything is pre-measured, prepped, laid out, etc_.

I spent many hours finding pallets, transporting them, cutting them to size, augmenting slats, prepping a site, screwing them together, etc. 

Many hours. It sucked. It'll be way faster next time. I have better explicit and tacit knowledge around this step. 

## Smell

There's no smell. I regularly stick my head over the compost container and inhale deeply. I expect to smell nothing but hay or leaves, and am usually correct.

If I'm wrong, I add more cover material, and repeat.

It goes through a lot of leaves. I now try to "steal" bags of leaves from my neighbors, because they're a perfect cover material. 

I'm getting a _lot_ of compost, which will soon support a bunch of planting I'll be doing around the lot.
